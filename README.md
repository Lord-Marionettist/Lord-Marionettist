### Radical Pragmatist | Data Logistics & System Automation

I engineer resilient pipelines to extract, transform, and leverage data. I focus on utility, bypassing noise to deliver structured, high-signal assets from distributed systems.

## ⚙️ Core Operations
* **Automated ETL Pipelines:** Designing self-sustaining data extraction tools navigating network constraints.
* **Algorithmic Bypassing:** Implementing dynamic backoff strategies to maintain persistent access to adversarial endpoints.
* **System Automation:** Converting manual data gathering into autonomous, revenue-generating operations.

## 🛠 The Arsenal
**Mastery (First-Principles Understanding):**
* JavaScript / TypeScript (Node.js ecosystem manipulation)
* Python (Data processing and network traversal)
* React / Next.js (Interface architecture)

**Familiarity (Operational Execution):**
* Rust (Memory-safe systems programming)
* Tailwind CSS (Rapid UI deployment)

## 📊 Concrete Impact
* **Project:** Data Sniper
* **Mechanics:** Engineered an autonomous Node.js pipeline to systematically extract and structure e-commerce pricing data.
* **Outcome:** Powers monthly revenue generation for a mid-size enterprise through strategic data arbitrage.
