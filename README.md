### The Pragmatist: I convert network I/O into capital.

I engineer resilient data pipelines and autonomous systems. I discard aesthetic noise in favour of structural utility, building tools that extract, transform, and load high-signal assets from distributed networks.

## ⚙️ Core Operations
* **Automated ETL Pipelines:** Designing self-sustaining Node.js architectures to navigate network constraints and extract structured data.
* **Algorithmic Bypassing:** Implementing dynamic feedback loops and backoff strategies to maintain persistent access to adversarial API endpoints.
* **Ephemeral System Architecture:** Building pipelines that stream data directly to cloud storage (via APIs), ensuring complete resilience against local server faults.
* **System Automation:** Converting manual data gathering into autonomous operations.

## 🛠 The Arsenal
**Mastery (First-Principles Execution):**
* `JavaScript` / `TypeScript` (Event-loop manipulation, async data logistics)
* `Python` (Data processing, network traversal)
* `Next.js` / `React` (Interface architecture)

**Familiarity (Operational Deployment):**
* `Rust` (Memory-safe systems programming)
* `Tailwind CSS` (Rapid UI deployment)

## 📊 Concrete Impact
* **System:** Profit Sniper
* **Mechanics:** Engineered an autonomous Node.js pipeline to systematically extract and structure e-commerce pricing data. Utilized dynamic rate-limit handling to evade WAF defenses without escalating to resource-heavy headless browsers. 
* **Outcome:** Powers automated monthly revenue generation for a mid-size enterprise through strategic data arbitrage 📈.

## 🧠 Operating Principles
* **Resource Asymmetry:** Achieving maximum systemic output with minimal computational input. Prioritising the rapid deployment and silent mutation of logic to bypass evolving network resistance, intervening at the lowest possible layer of abstraction.
